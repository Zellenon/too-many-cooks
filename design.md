# Game Design Document

## Base Concept
Player isn't powerful enough to kill enemies the 'right' way, but the game is shittily made and has non-intentional-seeming ways to getting rid of enemies built-in

## Current Gameplay Progress Plan
1. Game start, player shooting regular mooks. The gun is kind of weak, but also stuns enemies.
2. Tank enemies are introduced. The weak gun doesn't kill them nearly fast enough.
3. Healers come in at the same time. Players eventually realize that overhealing will kill the tanks.
4. Healers start healing each other to death. Player has to use their stun gun to prevent them from healing each other so as many healers can be alive at once as possible.
5. Swarm enemies are introduced. Healing them all from their tiny health to the overflow point is impractical, so another method of removal needs to be introduced
6. etc.

## Not-Yet Accepted Ideas

- When there are more than X bullets on screen at once, the oldest despawn - but they buff the remaining bullets left onscreen.
